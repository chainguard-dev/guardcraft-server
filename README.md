# GuardCraft - Guarded Containerized Minecraft Server

GuardCraft is a containerized Minecraft (Java) server that is designed to be secure and easy to use. It is built on top of the [Java JRE Chainguard Image](https://images.chainguard.dev/directory/image/jre/versions). 

![0CVE - GuardCraft](./resources/0cve.png)

## Features
The GuardCraft server is designed to be secure and easy to use. It includes the following features:
- Minimal container image with low-to-zero CVEs
- Easy configuration with environment variables
- Easy setup with Docker Compose

Currently, Guardcraft is available only for Minecraft Java version.

*This setup was validated on an Ubuntu 24.04 system.*

## Usage
To build the image, run:

```shell
docker build -t guardcraft-java .
```

Use the following command to run the image in your local environment:

```shell
docker compose up
```
You should be able to see output with relevant information about the server setup:

```shell

```

Once the server is up and running, you can connect to it using a Minecraft Java client **on the same local network**.

To connect to the server, you'll need to add a new server using the host machine's local IP address and port `25565` (the default port). You can also use the `localhost` address if you're running the server on the same machine as the client.

> Find your local IP address on Linux systems: `ip -o route get to 8.8.8.8 | sed -n 's/.*src \([0-9.]\+\).*/\1/p'`

![Connect to Server](./resources/connect-java.png)
When connecting, you should see details about your user on the server logs:

```shell
java-server-1  | [18:12:21] [Server thread/INFO]: Server empty for 60 seconds, pausing

java-server-1  | [18:14:30] [Server thread/INFO]: boredcatmom joined the game

## Configuration
The GuardCraft server can be configured using dynamic environment variables that get replaced in the `server.properties` file. Any properties can be configured with the following format: `MC_<property_name>`. Hyphens (`-`) should be replaced with underscores (`_`). For example, to set the `server-port` property, use the `MC_server_port` environment variable.

Included `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  java-server:
    image: guardcraft-java
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 25565:25565
    environment:
      # Server properties Set Up
      # MC_* variables will be replaced in the server.properties file
      # Hyphens should be replaced with underscores
      MC_gamemode: "survival"
      MC_difficulty: "easy"
      MC_motd: "Welcome to GuardCraft!"
      MC_level_name: "GuardCraft"
      MC_level_seed: "-1718501946501227358"
      # GuardCraft Custom Resource pack
      # Using a CDN while the repo is private, later on move to repo release files
      MC_resource_pack: "https://cdn.erikaheidi.com/minecraft/GuardCraft_Resource_Pack.zip"
      MC_require_resource_pack: "true"
```

This will set up a server in **Survival** mode, with **Easy** difficulty, and a **Welcome to GuardCraft!** message of the day. The server will be named **GuardCraft** and will use the specified seed to generate the world. You should spawn in an area with a village nearby.
